# Sazzaj Tower Defense 

Playground for various experiments disguised as a infinite procedural Tower Defense game.

Current experiments:
* pathfinding using BFS and A* algos
* tower defence map generation using a single entry and a single exit points with various intersections/junctions -> generates two pngs one for show and one for procedurally determining walkable areas.
* generate pathfinding grid from map generation
* simple AI unit spawner, AI goes from entry point to exit point
* two building types (slow and damage) placed by user
* limited number of buildings
* reset/pause options
