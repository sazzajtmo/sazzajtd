Playground for various experiments disguised as a Tower Defence game.

Current experiments:
* pathfinding using BFS and A* algos
* tower defence map generation using a single entry and a single exit points with various intersections/junctions -> generates two pngs one for show and one for procedurally determining walkable areas.
* generate pathfinding grid from map generation
* simple 1 second AI unit spawner, AI goes from entry point to exit point
